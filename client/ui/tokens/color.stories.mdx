# Color Tokens

The demosplan-ui colors are grouped into "scale" (the raw values which should not be used directly), "brand" (for
colors used in branded context), "message" and "status" (to communicate system state), "data" (for data visualization)
and "interaction" (to indicate interaction). apart from "brand", colors are not meant to be themeable.

## Color scales

Available color scales contain 7 steps: a base color plus 2 shades and 4 lights.

## Neutrals

Black, white, and greys.

## Data visualization colors

The 4 distinct scales can be used for data visualizations with a defined number of needed colors that differentiate
from each other.

These are generated with https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=BrBG&n=8 to be colorblind safe
and intentionally separate from other color scales.

Although these colors are universally used for charts, they need to be refined into "sequential", "categorical",
and "diverging" when appropriate. Read more if the need arises:

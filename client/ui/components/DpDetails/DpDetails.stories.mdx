# Details

The `DpDetails` component is used to reveal detailed information only when users need it. Other than the accordion or
expandable table, it is not used to display tabular data or multiple items of the same type and structure - it rather
represents a single chunk of information that is shortened to ease scanning of the content it is part of.

export const Template = (args, { argTypes }) => ({
    props: Object.keys(argTypes),
    components: { DpDetails },
    template: `<dp-details v-bind="propsWithoutDefaultSlot" v-on="$props">${typeof args.default !== 'undefined' ? args.default : ''}</dp-details>`,
    computed: {
        propsWithoutDefaultSlot() {
            const all = this.$props
            delete all['default']
            return all
        }
    }
});

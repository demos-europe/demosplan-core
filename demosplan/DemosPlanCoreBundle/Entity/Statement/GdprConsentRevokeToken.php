/**
 * This token allows the anonymization of statements connected to it directly or indirectly.
 *
 * Tokens are (as of writing) only provided to unregistered citizens, as these by definition do not
 * have an account where they could list all their submitted statements and revoke their GDPR
 * consent. However the usage of tokens is (as of writing) not limited by roles to allow users to
 * register at a later point in time and still being able to use the link while being logged in.
 *
 * All existing token instances should be considered as allowed to be used. This means an instance
 * should only be created when its usage is allowed. In contrast creating tokens in advance for
 * statements which are not intended to be revoked by a token (currently all statements not
 * submitted by unregistered citizens) is wrong.
 *
 * The token must neither have a created-date nor a used-date as these would make it possible to
 * connect the token after usage to the statements or the GdprConsent of the statement. A
 * valid-till date was deemed as not needed. If it is at some point however the date problematic
 * must be taken into account too while considering substraction of fixed time span values.
 *
 * The usage of the token is possible only once. However the token must not be deleted to be able
 * to inform the user that the token was already used in case he tries to use it multiple times.

     * Even though only one statement can be submitted at once and a new token should be created

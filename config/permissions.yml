# @link: https://yaits.demos-deutschland.de/w/demosplan/functions/permissions/technical/ permissions structure & rules

# Menu highlighting is dependent on the permission being enabled and on the permission being an "area". Hence, if it's
# in the menu, it should also be an area.

# Attributes should be sorted alphabetically:
# description: long description, with roles, ticket numbers, knock yourself out. The more you write the better!
# label: short description
# loginRequired: self-explanatory
# parent / parents: we haven't made our minds up about this yet. as of now, it's not used in the code. However, the idea
#                   is that a parent is always less than the child. And if the child is enabled, the parent must always
#                   be enabled, too.

    description: |
        Used to gain access to the source-statement file via the api. This permission is a replica of feature_import_statement_pdf
        because that permission is addon-specific and cannot be used for additional non addon related checks within the core.
        Access to the source-statement without this addon is necessary, so this permission substitutes the old one.
